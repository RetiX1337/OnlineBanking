## About The Project

![user-page](https://github.com/RetiX1337/OnlineBanking/assets/32012511/3c6a9274-01b6-4112-96e9-c9126cd1f924)

Welcome to the Online Banking project! This project is a web-based application that simulates the functionality of an online banking system. It’s designed to provide a convenient and secure way for users to manage their bank accounts, make transactions, etc.

This project is built using the Spring Framework and Hibernate, two powerful and widely-used technologies in the Java ecosystem. Spring provides the infrastructure for developing robust and scalable enterprise-grade applications, while Hibernate simplifies the data access layer with its powerful ORM capabilities.

Key features of this application include account creation and management, fund transfers, transaction history viewing, and more. The application follows the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) paradigm, ensuring a comprehensive and intuitive user experience.

## Built With

Java Core, Spring Framework (Core, MVC, Security), Hibernate, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5, Thymeleaf, Maven, MySQL, etc.
